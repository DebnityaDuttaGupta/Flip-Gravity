Aim : To Create a Gravity Flip Type of Game Demo

At 8:22 PM July 25 : Uploaded the cloned version of the git file

At 5:48 PM July 26 : Made a fully functional 3rd Person Camera using the FreeLook Cinemachine Package

At 9:32 PM July 26 : Made Some Changes to the 3rd Person Camera so it doesn't get obstructed my the obstacle behind the player ad made some basic movement script so the player can move in x-z axis using wasd keys while having some drag setting implemented to as to slow down the player if needed.

At 1:52 PM July 27 : Forgot to commit before to add additional info about changes made to movement script so now it has jump movement with air multiplier if needed with a proper jump, idle, running, falling idle animation attached properly to each line of code + the current commit changes made the gravity flip by using the player as the pivot point / origin point for the environment to rotate around and having the rotate only possible when pressing arrow keys with having the rotation play at a slow speed

At 8:22 PM July 27 : Made some bug fixing to the gravity flip + furthermore adding holographic model show up when pressing the arrow keys to flip and then finally pressing enter to rotate the environment while having the player stay in place. + Added Timer of 2 mins that appears on top right of the screen with when reaching 0:00 shows game over but if the player collects all 5 cubes and is grounded then it will have a You win Screen but if the player has collected all the boxes but is still in air he/she shall lose.
